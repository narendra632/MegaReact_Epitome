## Technologies used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React lets you create reusable UI components and manage the state and lifecycle of your app.

- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight development tool for React and other web frameworks. Vite provides hot module replacement, TypeScript support, and ESLint integration.

- **Appwrite**: A backend service that provides various functionalities to mobile, web, and Flutter applications. Appwrite handles user authentication, database, storage, functions, and more.

- **Tailwind**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Tailwind offers responsive, customizable, and animated styles for your app.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features. TypeScript helps you write more reliable and maintainable code, and catch errors before they happen.

- **React Dropzone**: A React component that allows you to create a drag-and-drop area for file uploads. React Dropzone handles the file selection, validation, and preview for you.

- **React Intersection Observer**: A React component that uses the Intersection Observer API to detect when an element is visible or intersects with another element. React Intersection Observer is useful for implementing lazy loading, infinite scroll, or animations based on scroll position.

- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. shadcn/ui components are accessible, customizable using tailwind, and open source.

- **TanStack Query (React Query)**: A library for powerful asynchronous state management for TS/JS, React, Solid, Vue and Svelte. React Query offers features such as auto caching, auto refetching, infinite scroll queries, pagination, SSR support, and mutations API.
